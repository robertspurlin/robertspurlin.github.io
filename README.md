# Robert Spurlin Homepage

A rebuild of my portfolio using React and React Static, because why not.

Blog is built and compiled using markdown files, and Projects is built by reading a YAML file.

`/dist/` is where GitHub Pages is serving the content (see gh-pages branch).

Recreating in a local environment for developing should be as easy as cloning this repository, `npm i`, and `npm run start`.
