*TL;DR - use WoeUSB.*
```
sudo woeusb --device /path/to/Win11_23H2_English_x64.iso /dev/sdX # replace /dev/sdX with your drive location
```

In an attempt to help a family member upgrade parts in their PC, I found myself in an interesting pickle - how would I create a bootable USB to install Windows 11 without an extra Windows computer laying around? 

I've been a software developer for the better part of six years now - almost all of it done on my trusty Mac laptop. However, that doesn't mean that my Windows knowledge of lives past lived is completely useless. We installed a new M.2 drive in the machine, and struggled with getting the partions correct for a perfect clone of the existing hard drive since the hard drive was 2TB but the M.2 drive was 1TB. After confirming that the cloning functionality in RescueZilla would not work, we opted to install Windows 11 on the M.2 drive, and to migrate what was lost later.

This was harder than it should've been, frankly, especially since the Windows 11 ISO is free to download via Microsoft's website. Various articles found using Google-fu either suggested using the Media Creation Tool on _another_ Windows 11 machine (not possible in my case), or downloading the ISO yourself and "burning" it to the USB. 

More articles pointed to using `dd` to get the job done - including commands like such:
```
sudo dd if=/path/to/Win11_23H2_English_x64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8192
```

I can confirm that this gave the illusion of it working once I had the machine boot off the USB, but actually installing Windows failed. The only error that it gave was a red herring - "A media driver your computer needs is missing". 

Finally, after way too much back and forth of
- wiping the drive completely,
- removing all partitions off of the USB,
- trying something different,

nothing worked. Until I ran into WoeUSB. After installing WoeUSB on my media server (Ubuntu), I plugged in the USB drive and ran this command - 
```
sudo woeusb --device /path/to/Win11_23H2_English_x64.iso /dev/sdX # replace /dev/sdX with your drive location
```

and let it run overnight. In the morning, I was greeted with a success message, and after booting from the USB again, we were off to the races.

I decided to write this up in hopes that someone who is deep in Google trying to find the correct answer for this - I hope it helps that someone.
